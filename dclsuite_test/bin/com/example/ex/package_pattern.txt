In this package, follow the following guidelines for test assurance:

- Classes should be subclasses of an Exception type, e.g., Exception
- Classes should start with "Ex" followed by a two digit number. For example: Ex01, Ex02, Ex03, etc.
- Methods in these classes should start with "h" followed by a number. For example: h1, h2, h3, etc.
